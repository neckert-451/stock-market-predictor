# Stock Market Predictor Algorithm

This respo contains all the code and files for the stock market predictor application that I create while employed at AI Solutions during Summer 2020.

File information:
* LSTM for Stock Predictions: stock predictor algorithm with a long-short term memory (LSTM) network
* LSTM with GUI v1: stock predictor algorithm with an LSTM network and user-interface GUI
* ar_model.py: stock predictor with an autoregressor (AR) model
* exporting_predictions.py: outputting stock prediction results to a .CSV file
* predictions.py: stock market predictor with a GUI, statistics, autoregression model, persistance model, and plot results
* python code A: FINAL PRODUCT stock market predictor -- predicts stocks 7 days out based on historical data
* stock_predictor_gui_v2.py: FINAL PRODUCT stock predictor algorithm that outputs stock predictions based on user input
